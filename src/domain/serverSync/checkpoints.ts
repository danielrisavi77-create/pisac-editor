/**
 * The wire contract for checkpoints (F1-5b), between the client and
 * `public.pisac_create_checkpoint`
 * (supabase/migrations/2026091906_f1_checkpoints.sql).
 *
 * Pure TypeScript: no Supabase, Next.js or React imports, so every branch is
 * unit-testable without a database. The RPC answers with a jsonb object; the
 * network, a proxy or a future migration can all hand us something else, so
 * nothing here trusts the shape it is given.
 *
 * What a checkpoint is, and is not:
 *
 *   - It is a NAME the author put on a revision the SERVER holds. The content
 *     is read inside the definer function from `pisac_documents`, so there is
 *     no request field for it here either — a client that could supply the
 *     bytes could name a checkpoint after something the server never held.
 *   - It is therefore NOT a snapshot of local durable state. Anything still in
 *     the pending queue is by definition not in it, and the UI is required to
 *     say so (`UNSYNCED_CHANGES_NOTE`) rather than let the author assume it.
 *     That is the same rule the eight sync states exist for: local durable
 *     state is not canonical server state, and one must never be shown as the
 *     other.
 *   - It is immutable. There is no rename, no delete and, in F1, no restore
 *     (that is F2+, see docs/F1_STATE.md). Nothing in this module produces a
 *     request that would change one.
